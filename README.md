# credit-risk-classification
* This is the module 20 assignment for bootcamp, which focuses on training a model based on loan risk. The dataset is made up historical data of lending activity from a lending services company. 

## Credit Risk Analysis


* The purpose of this analysis is to determine the credit worthiness of borrowers. I have been provided with financial information on the borrowers and built a model based off of that information to see if the borrower is a credit risk.

* The financial information that was provided is as follows: the size of the loan, the interest rate, the borrowers income, the debt to income ratio, the number of accounts the borrower has, the number of derogatory remarks on their credit report, and the borrowers total debt. I am analyzing this information to predict the borrowers loan status, this is divided into 2 categories, 0 and 1. 0 means a good loan, 1 is at a high risk for defaulting on the loan.  

* The dataset has information on a total of 77,536 loans. 2,500 of those loans are high risk, and 75,036 are healthy loans. 

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
